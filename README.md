The project comprises of two main components. The first component aims at devising efficient Parity Check Matrix and Generator Matrix pairs in line with the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) guidelines. These pairs are intended for utilization in spacecraft communications, where they are expected to offer high reliability even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication channels. The second component involves implementing the Sum-Product algorithm, also known as the Belief Propagation algorithm, and presenting a simple numerical example to demonstrate its functionality. Furthermore, the Sum-Product algorithm is employed to decode a message that has been encoded using the Generator Matrix specified in the CCSDS standards.
